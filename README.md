# Julia Function Edge Case Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Julia function that involves conditional return statements. The function `myfunction` calculates the square of the input for positive numbers and the negative of the square for negative numbers. However, it doesn't explicitly handle the case where the input is zero, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution provides a corrected version that explicitly handles the zero case.

## Bug Description
The original code calculates the square of the input if it's positive and the negative of the square if it's negative. The problem arises when the input is zero; because the behavior is not explicitly defined, the result might not be what's expected.

## Solution
The solution adds an explicit `elseif` condition to handle the case when `x` is equal to zero, ensuring the function returns 0 in that scenario.
